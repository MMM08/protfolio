    <h2>Creativity</h2>
    <p> Around the time of 2015 in the end of the summer begaining of the fall,
       I started to be into creative. Making some quotes and just sharing a 
       great thought to wonderful people I knew and show love to them. Many were 
       thankful of the little things I did for them and it wasn't so big. A visit 
       from families and advice they would like to hear, most important letting them 
       kmow in hard times it is hard seeing the light at the end of the tunal. Through 
       this I write quotes to lift them up and make there day.</p>

      <h2>Leader</h2>
      <p>I always wanted a little brother mainly because my sister was super boring. While living in Utah
        I have family members here who have kids of there own. I got the chance to watch them and have a
        great time with them. There is time when lessons would take place. That is when I come by 
        talk to them and see how there cousin can help them out. As they grew up, there choice they've made
        where thought the leaders they look up too. You don't ask for it; it just comes naturally.

      <h2>Action</h2>
      <p>Is there a right or wrong? Many people may say yes due to there stander beliefs and other's may not 
        think so. Other then that of course people do things for some reason or do them just because. Who takes 
        risks? Who takes the leap of faith? What does this mean? Well is anyone willing to take a risk 
        knowing where they stand in there life is hard? Many people may desagree or not support you 
        due to beliving this is to good to be true. You just need to trust yourself, work hard for this 
        and things will fall into place.

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      <p> My life, is every where. I grew up in New York, moved to Utah, parents divorce,
        have traunme in my life and still I am here standing. No one would think that 
        someone like me would be where I am at. There is time to time when things get 
        hard or pain comes a long. One thing for a fact is having words that stand out 
        to me and keeps me going.
