                            <p class="ex1">While growin up as a child through my families example
                              I learned what it meant to accept others the way they are. 
                              They've show me the importance of charity. Showing me how we 
                              have so much here to be thankful for other's don't but 
                              us sharing what we have shows a love for one another. As I 
                              was coming tours my teenage years, my family moved to Utah. 
                              While living in Utah another chapter comes to my life growing up
                              with a single mom. Through her example she taught me how education is 
                              important, every hard work is worth it at the end because of the reward 
                              that comes with it. She is a great examply in my life of hard work.
                            </p>
                            <p>While growing up, I have had and still have family memember's impact
                              my life. I have a cousin in Utah who encouraged me on to going to college
                            I decided to take her adive and since then my life hasn't been the same.
                              Deciding going to college and just doing my general's I learned about coding.
                              I didn't realized that I would ended up liking it so much. Which brought me 
                              to where I am at right now. My grandmother, since I was a little girl she has
                              been there for me, teaching me to always be strong in hard times. She didn't 
                              like seeing me cry or be upset. She is someone who loved making jokes and 
                              made sure I had a smile on my face. A couple of my uncle's in my life have taught me 
                              great values of the meaning of living my life and the kind of man I should for as 
                              a husband. They taught me lesson's of learning to move forward when my parents where 
                              getting a divorce and as they are divorced. One of my uncle taught me of
                              how life is short, time flys so fast in a blink of an eye a lot will happen unexpected
                              the question is are you ready? Of course there is time I won't be but at the end 
                              he taught me of the importance of living and seeing what I love to do. If it wasn't for
                              him I wouldn't have taken this chance on coming to Helio Training.
